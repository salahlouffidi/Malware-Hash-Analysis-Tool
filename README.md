# Malware-Hash-Analysis-Tool
A Python tool for fetching malware hashes from Malshare.com and querying them on VirusTotal for YARA rule and name information

# Malware Hash Analysis


This project allows you to input a date and fetch the malware hashes from Malshare.com for that date. It then queries each hash on VirusTotal using the VirusTotal API to retrieve information about YARA rules and names associated with the hashes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- requests library (can be installed via `pip install requests`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-hash-analysis.git

## Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Obtain a VirusTotal API key:
Sign up on the VirusTotal website if you don't have an account.
Generate an API key in your account settings.
##Update the API key in the script:
# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual VirusTotal API key
headers = {"x-apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}

Usage
Run the script:
python malware_hash_analysis.py

Enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD when prompted.

The script will fetch the file list from Malshare.com for the specified date and query each hash on VirusTotal.

Process the VirusTotal results as per your requirements. You can modify the code in malware_hash_analysis.py to extract specific information such as YARA rules and names.

Configuration Options
You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the configuration options in malware_hash_analysis.py. For example, you can adjust the number of concurrent API requests or specify additional fields to retrieve from VirusTotal.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while using the tool, consider the following steps:

Check your internet connection and ensure you can access Malshare.com and VirusTotal.com.
Verify that you have provided a valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD) when prompted.
Make sure your VirusTotal API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
If the problem persists, please open an issue with details about the error.
